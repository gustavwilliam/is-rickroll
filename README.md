# Is rickroll?
Never be fooled by a rickroll again.

Use your command line superpowers to easily check if the strange looking link from your friend is a rickroll. It's this simple to use:
```
$ rickroll https://seph.club/not-a-rickroll
RICKROLL!
```
```
$ rickroll https://google.com
Safe.
```
This command goes down all those pesky redirects to find out what the sender really had in mind. Use your newly found powers wisely and you will never be rickrolled again â€” ever.
